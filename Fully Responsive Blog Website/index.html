    <h4 class="solutions">Programming</h4>
    <p>I have been interested in programming since a young age, beginning my journey in the 9th grade. As a technical student, I completed both my 9th and 10th grades with a strong focus on computer science. My early exposure to programming languages has allowed me to develop a solid foundation in C and C++. As a part of the curriculum in 9th grade, I was mandatory to take C language as a subject and in 10th grade, I had C++. As a result, I am now at an intermediate level in both C and C++, with a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts and the ability to apply them in real-world situations. And an Average student found interest in the field of web development during their 10th grade and decided to make a career out of it by striving to become a and proficient web developer.</p>

    <h4 class="solutions">Cooking</h4>
   <p> Besides these tech skills, I have a passion for cooking that burns hotter than a pepper and a skill set that is as diverse as a spice rack. My kitchen is my playground and I am always experimenting with new flavors and techniques to keep things exciting. My friends lick their fingers 100 times over after finishing the meal prepared by me due to my delicious taste of food and the tasteness of food make them say "mmm! Bhai maja aagaya". Once you try the food prepared by me, you'll be a fan of mine! In fact, you might even fall head over heels in love with me...if you're a girl. But I won't do because I'm already commited with Computer. Anyway, I like to cook.</p>

       <p> My name is Dharmendra Sharma. I am from an extremly small village where my villager doesn't know "what is CPU Case?". You got it, the situation of my village and where I live. When I saw the computer first time, I fell in ❤️ with her, (sorry with "it" because Computer is a thing). By the way, I am from a extremly middle class family background where my parent is uneducated and they don't have trust on me that I will be a successfull man one day, but they always supported me for my study. And I prefer to live alone, until I and my <span title="Mr Bikesh AKA Sound" > best friend </span>are not together.</p>
